The design uses a Cloudflare Worker as a public HTTPS entry point that automatically scales across Cloudflare’s global edge, routing each incoming request to a Durable Object multiplexer that maintains persistent WebSocket connections to lightweight client agents. Each agent—running on a user’s device or server—authenticates with a bearer token, opens one outbound WebSocket to the Durable Object, and listens for framed request messages containing method, path, headers, and body data. When the Worker receives an HTTPS request, it forwards it via the Durable Object to the correct agent’s socket; the agent makes the local HTTP call (for example, to http://127.0.0.1:8000), streams the response back over the same WebSocket, and the Worker returns it to the user. The client implementation is minimal: a few hundred lines in Go or Rust that handle authentication, reconnect logic, JSON framing, and streaming I/O, enabling thousands of users to have independent, low-cost “personal tunnels” through the Cloudflare edge without needing any Cloudflare client or VPN software.
